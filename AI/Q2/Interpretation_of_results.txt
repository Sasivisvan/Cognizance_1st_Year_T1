As everything is 0 means no emepty or incomplete data field

Performance of each model as Mean Squared Error meaning sum of (predicted value - actual value)^2 divided by no of times predicted:
Linear Regression - Test set Mean Squared Error: 0.0723
Ridge Regression - Test set Mean Squared Error: 0.0696
Random Forest Regressor - Test set Mean Squared Error: 0.0542

Best model based on test set: Random Forest Regressor

The best model to use is (based on this test) is Random Forest Regressor
